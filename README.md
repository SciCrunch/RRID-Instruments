# RRID-Instruments
Location for RRID instrument documentation

This is a storage place for Manufacturer Specifications for scientific instruments (capital equiment). Included here is set of instrument specification files, or the closest thing that we found availble from the manufacturers. 

The reason that this list exists is because manufacturers frequently remove these specifications from their websites and people loose access to them. For scientific integrity we are attempting to capture these specifications for scientific instruments (focusing on capital equipment).
