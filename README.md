# RRID-Instruments
Location for RRID instrument documentation

This is a storage place for Manufacturer Specifications for scientific instruments (capital equiment). Included here is set of instrument specification files, or the closest thing that we found availble from the manufacturers. 

The reason that this list exists is because manufacturers frequently remove these specifications from their websites and people loose access to them. For scientific integrity we are attempting to capture these specifications for scientific instruments (focusing on capital equipment). 

Project start: 2023
Grant: R24GM144308
How to find instruments that we have cataloged: rrid.site -> tools -> facet "instrument resource" (shortcut to URL https://rrid.site/data/source/nlx_144509-1/search?q=%2A&l=%2A&facet[]=Resource%20Type%3Ainstrument%20resource)

If your instrument exists in this list, please cite it using the RRID in your papers or grants, if not then please join us by registering any capital equipment important to your research (or if you are a manufacturer we are happy to work with you to get your data added):
rrid.site -> add new resource button
